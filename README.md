# hello-world
I am a GSOC aspirant and currently i am pursuing UG in CSE.
I am doing my B.tech from one of the prestigious colleges of INDIA namely NIT HAMIRPUR.
My college is located in the land of God i.e Himachal Pradesh.
The beauty of this area is spell-bounded.
I can see the snow claded mountain from my hostel and it has been a very nice experience since i joined this college.
